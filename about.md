Hi, I'm Steph. I'm the writer of this blog. (And other things.) But I'm not the real kind of writer. I'm the kind that writes ads and websites and Facebook posts for brands. And now I'm in the process of learning to write some code. So this blog will follow the trials and tribulations of my progress. It may get interesting, but it will most definitely get amusing (for everyone else).
