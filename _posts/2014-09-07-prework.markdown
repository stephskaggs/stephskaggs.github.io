The reality check of signing up for MakerSquare has set in. Holy moly I have a lot of prework to do. I raced through the HTML and CSS Code Academy work without a sweat. So naturally I assumed the rest would be just as simple...
But alas...then I reached the exercise about command line and Git. GIT? What? I've never even heard that word before. And honestly, I've never accessed my computer's terminal...I'm not sure I knew that was even an option. At the time, I decided that command line and Git were, in fact, the worst.
That is, until I reached JavScript. I've had a few people tell me that once JS clicks you think it's the greatest thing ever. I can say with complete assurance that it has definitely not clicked for me. Because it made my life completely miserable. If not for the Q/A forum on Code Academy I'm pretty sure my browser would still be stuck in an infinite loop. It's hard. And it made me feel like shit just got real.
Bring on the actual classes.
