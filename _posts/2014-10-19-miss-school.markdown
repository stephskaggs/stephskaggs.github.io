Monday’s class was great. A lesson in responsive and Foundation. I work on responsive websites for a living, so it’s a theory I completely understand. And I’ve been working on a Bootstrap project at work, so Foundation is pretty simple.

But then I had to travel for the rest of the week for work and I missed Wednesday’s class. And I can say with the utmost authority that it was a terrible time to travel. The class was all working on JS exercises. ALL JS EXERCISES. Which means that I had to do them all on my own over the weekend and a completely exhausting work trip. Blerg. No fun. The worst. It was all of those things. 

On top of that, I wasn’t feeling well and just wanted to sleep. It was one of those times that I was extremely happy that they included a working solution with each of the exercises. Because while I did attempt them all on my own, I cannot say that I was able to figure all of them out. Especially that damn shopping cart. 

The restaurant project is next week and I really hope I can get through it after my success this weekend.
