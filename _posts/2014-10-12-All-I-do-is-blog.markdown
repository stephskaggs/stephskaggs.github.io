Week five included learning Jekyll and working on more JS. Jekyll is a blog platform of sorts and it’s pretty fun. It comes with some preset styles that you can work with or ignore.  But after playing with it all weekend, I wish I had just stripped out all of the preset styles instead of trying to make them do what I want them to do. My blog looks okay. I got the homepage to look like I wanted it to, but the lower level pages are not really working yet. Going to have to mess with it a lot more. But we finally got to build something instead of just working on exercises.

And the JS exercise we worked on was building a filter. And I actually did it. Yes, I worked with Juliana. But it all actually made sense. Which is great because this is the first JS work in 5 weeks that has made any sense at all. 

I have to miss class next Wednesday to travel for work. It’s making me a little anxious because I’m afraid of falling behind. But there’s not really anything I can do to prevent it. I’ll just have to see how it goes.
