Learning Jekyll was all fun and games until Sunday night at about 8pm. That’s when this started showing up in terminal…

First thought? CSS error. No biggie. Let the debugging begin. But then I spent the next four hours searching that damn file for anything and everything that could be an error. Four times I thought I found it, and four times I was wrong. 

I finally gave up around midnight and went to bed. But as soon as I laid down I remembered that the last thing I had been playing with was an H4. Only I was having issues in my CSS file so I started playing with it in the SASS file. 

I immediately got out of bed and found the error in the SASS file. Why did it say it was in my CSS file? Just to torture me, I assume. But I fixed it. And I did it on my own. 

And then I saw this...
